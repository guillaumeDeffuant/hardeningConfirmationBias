# hardeningConfirmationBias
This R script includes includes the models studied in the paper entitled "How opinions get more extreme in an era of information abundance"
by Guillaume Deffuant, Marijn Keijzer and Sven Banisch.
The models simulate an agent that consults content about a topic.
At each consultation, the content is chosen at random in a set of available content.
Tow models are included:
- The bounded confidence (BC) model
- The Persuasive Argument (PA) model

In each model, the main assumption is that the confirmation bias hardens when the opinion gets more extreme.
The main result is that, ageents consulting abundant information tend to get extreme opinions.
When running the scripts, the user can run indidual trajectorties and visualise them or run numerous trajectoires and visualise the resulting distribution of opinions
